# Riiid-Student-Performance-Prediction
Riiid Labs, an AI solutions provider delivering creative disruption to the education market, empowers global education players to rethink traditional ways of learning leveraging AI. With a strong belief in equal opportunity in education, Riiid launched an AI tutor based on deep-learning algorithms in 2017 that attracted more than one million South Korean students. This year, the company released EdNet, the world’s largest open database for AI education containing more than 100 million student interactions.  In this competition, your challenge is to create algorithms for "Knowledge Tracing," the modeling of student knowledge over time. The goal is to accurately predict how students will perform on future interactions. You will pair your machine learning skills using Riiid’s EdNet data.  Your innovative algorithms will help tackle global challenges in education. If successful, it’s possible that any student with an Internet connection can enjoy the benefits of a personalized learning experience, regardless of where they live. With your participation, we can build a better and more equitable model for education in a post-COVID-19 world.
